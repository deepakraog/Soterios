### Making Changes

#### Keep Changes Focused

Try to keep pull requests small and focused. Good examples:

- Fix one bug
- Add one feature
- Improve one subsystem
- Update documentation

Avoid combining unrelated changes into one pull request.

#### Code Quality

Please:

- Write readable and maintainable code
- Add comments where behavior is not obvious
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies
- Handle errors safely
- Avoid exposing sensitive information in logs
- Follow existing project structure and style

#### Security Contributions

Because Soterios is a security-focused application, security reports are especially important.

Please do not publicly disclose:

- Vulnerabilities
- Exploitable bugs
- Bypass methods
- Sensitive implementation details

...until they have been reviewed. 

Include:

- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested mitigation (if known)

---

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

- Test your changes locally
- Verify existing features still work
- Check for runtime errors
- Test edge cases
- Confirm the application starts successfully

If your change affects system-level operations, test carefully.

---

### Pull Requests

Before opening a PR:

1. Make sure your branch is up to date
2. Ensure the application runs
3. Explain what changed
4. Explain why the change is needed

A good pull request includes:

```markdown
## Summary

## Motivation

---

### Commit Messages

Use clear and descriptive commit messages. Good examples:

```

```

Avoid vague messages like:

```

```

---

## Feature Requests

Feature ideas are welcome. When suggesting a feature, include:

- The problem it solves
